# Readability Metrics

## SMOG Index
The SMOG Index estimates the years of education a person needs to understand a piece of writing. A higher SMOG index indicates that the text is more difficult to understand.

## Coleman-Liau Index
The Coleman-Liau Index also estimates the grade level needed to understand a piece of text. It computes readability based on the average number of letters per 100 words and the average number of sentences per 100 words. Higher values indicate a higher grade level required for comprehension.

## Gunning Fog Index
Similar to the SMOG index and Coleman-Liau index, the Gunning Fog index measures the readability of a text. It estimates the number of years of formal education a person needs to understand the text on the first reading. A higher index indicates more complex text.

## Dale-Chall Readability Score
The Dale-Chall Readability Score estimates the readability of a text by considering the percentage of difficult words. The Dale-Chall list contains words that are familiar to most fourth-grade students. The lower the score, the easier the text is to understand.

## Automated Readability Index (ARI)
ARI produces an approximate representation of the grade level needed to comprehend a text. It considers the average number of characters per word and the average number of words per sentence. Higher values indicate more difficult text.
